# Text_search_engine
#*Python Search Engine*

This project is a mini representation of how a search engine like **GOOGLE** operates, however not shooting too big, since at this time matching GOOGLE's serach capabilities is way beyond scope. 
The following instructions need to be considered to search a querry "string" which may be present anywhere in any text file. The result is also ranked. Here comes the opportunity to include **Machine Learning** which may consider users serach history to rank the results. However this project has been kept simpler.

We have the buildindex.py file which as the name suggests creates a hashing between files and then reverse hashes the tex within.
